I forked and cloned the homework. I pulled up the instructions and it seemed I am to go through all the code and ensure the site is working well and to improve the code for the next people to work on it. 
the only thing I could not find working on site wat that when I clicked the button for Search engine optimization it did not navigate to that section of page.

 I located that the id="search-engine-optimization" was missing from the HTML. I was able to add this and now it it working correctly. 

I spaced everything out to look better and be easier to read. I also added comments to try and help explain what everything was. 

I added Alt text for the images should they not show. On Cost management there was a weird extra end IMG tag that I removed when I added the alt text. 
 
I changed the footer to a footer element. I feel thisl looks better than making it a class. 

NOTE to fix there are ID and Class showing on many thingscan I reduce this down to one thing and have less showing.   I attempted to not have 3 classes named different with exactly same attributes when I updated these to just one class and update the html its not loading correct. I am reverting back untill I can reseach this further. 

Added viewport for responsive website- 

I attempted to make the Div-header just a header and update the CSS. when I did this and removed the . from the .header in css from class to element it messed up the float and position of the large main image. I spent about two hours trying to get this to work as a header and ended up going back to the header as a Div for now. 

I am relly not satisfied with this and would like to spend more time. I will be resubmitting this again. I was happy to get the page all working together and to be able to add an update somethings.
